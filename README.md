# Sports Analytics Portfolio

This repository now hosts a Shiny portfolio with a home screen that links to multiple projects.
The first project explores 4th down decision-making in the NFL using `nflfastR` play-by-play data from 2018 to 2023.
It compares actual coaching decisions to an analytics-based recommendation model and visualizes trends, success rates, and league-wide behavior.
